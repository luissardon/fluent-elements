# Fluent Elements

> IMPORTANT: The Fluent Elements are a work in progress and subject to major changes until 1.0 release.

The Fluent Elements are a collection of [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) that implement a concept I like to call **Fluent Behavior**.

> TODO: Elavorate introduction

## Concept

I like to define **Fluent Behavior** as _"the technical ability, combined with semantic awareness, to smoothly and easily interact with native elements in a meaningful way"._
